  scoring_scale: 1-5  # 1: Poor, 2: Fair, 3: Good, 4: Very Good, 5: Excellent
  criteria:
    - name: Structure and Logic
      description: Assesses the memo's organization, including a clear executive summary, logical flow (e.g., problem → analysis → recommendation), and coherent progression of ideas without gaps or redundancy.
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Severely disorganized, lacking any clear structure or executive summary; ideas jump erratically, making it nearly impossible to follow the logic.
        2: Basic structure present but flawed, with some gaps, redundancies, or unclear transitions; requires significant effort to understand the flow.
        3: Adequate organization with a logical flow and summary, but minor issues like occasional redundancies or weak transitions persist.
        4: Strong structure with smooth, coherent progression; executive summary is clear, and ideas build logically with minimal flaws.
        5: Exemplary structure; seamless logic that effortlessly guides the reader, with a concise executive summary and flawless progression.
      weight: 15
    - name: Arguments and Evidence
      description: Evaluates the strength of claims, supported by credible data sources (e.g., market research, internal benchmarks, or clinical studies). Avoids unsubstantiated opinions.
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Arguments are weak, anecdotal, or entirely unsubstantiated; little to no evidence provided, leading to low credibility.
        2: Some arguments supported by basic evidence, but many claims remain vague or rely on weak sources; inconsistencies undermine strength.
        3: Arguments are generally solid with moderate evidence from credible sources; some claims could be better supported, but overall persuasive.
        4: Strong, well-supported arguments with diverse, high-quality evidence tailored to healthcare; few unsubstantiated points.
        5: Outstanding arguments backed by robust, comprehensive evidence from multiple credible sources; perfectly tailored and irrefutable in context.
      weight: 20
    - name: Clarity, Style, and Use of Financial Metrics
      description: Reviews writing quality for conciseness, professionalism, and accessibility (no jargon overload). Specifically, examines effective integration of key financial metrics (e.g., ROI, NPV, payback period, cost-benefit analysis) to quantify the investment's value.
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Writing is unclear, wordy, unprofessional, with excessive jargon or errors; financial metrics are absent or grossly misused.
        2: Somewhat clear but often verbose or awkward; limited use of financial metrics, with some inaccuracies or irrelevance.
        3: Generally clear and professional style; financial metrics are included and mostly accurate, though integration could be smoother.
        4: Very clear, concise, and engaging writing; effective use of relevant financial metrics that enhance understanding and persuasion.
        5: Exceptionally crisp, professional, and accessible style; masterful integration of accurate, insightful financial metrics that strongly support the case.
      weight: 15
    - name: Relevance and Strategic Alignment
      description: Measures how well the project ties to the company's overall goals, such as improving patient outcomes, operational efficiency, or competitive positioning in healthcare, without extraneous details.
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Project is largely irrelevant or misaligned with company goals; includes many extraneous details that distract from the core message.
        2: Some relevance but weak alignment; connections to strategic goals are vague, with noticeable irrelevant content.
        3: Adequately relevant with clear ties to goals; minimal extraneous details, though linkages could be more explicit.
        4: Highly relevant and well-aligned; strong, direct connections to strategic priorities without unnecessary information.
        5: Perfectly aligned with compelling relevance; seamless integration with company goals, focused entirely on essential elements.
      weight: 15
    - name: Clear Opportunity and Ask
      description: Examines the articulation of the investment opportunity (e.g., problem solved, benefits in healthcare delivery) and the specific request (e.g., funding amount, timeline, resources needed).
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Opportunity and ask are vague, incomplete, or poorly articulated; fails to convey benefits or specifics, leaving the reader confused.
        2: Basic outline of opportunity and ask, but lacks detail or justification; benefits are mentioned but not compelling.
        3: Clear opportunity with a specific ask; benefits and requests are adequately described, though could be more persuasive.
        4: Well-articulated opportunity with a precise, justified ask; compelling benefits that encourage action.
        5: Exceptionally clear and motivating opportunity; precise, fully justified ask that directly invites informed decision-making.
      weight: 15
    - name: Risk Mitigation
      description: Assesses identification of potential risks (e.g., regulatory hurdles, operational challenges, financial uncertainties in healthcare) and proposed mitigation strategies, showing foresight.
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Risks are ignored, downplayed, or not identified; no mitigation strategies, showing a lack of foresight.
        2: Few risks mentioned with superficial mitigations; analysis is incomplete and unrealistic.
        3: Key risks identified with basic mitigation strategies; demonstrates some foresight but lacks depth.
        4: Comprehensive risk identification with practical, proactive mitigations; strong foresight in healthcare context.
        5: Thorough, insightful risk analysis with innovative, realistic mitigations; exemplifies exceptional prudence and planning.
      weight: 15
    - name: Feasibility and Implementation
      description: Evaluates the practicality of the project, including a high-level plan for execution, timelines, resource allocation, and any healthcare-specific considerations like compliance or integration with existing systems.
      scoring_guidance:
        1: Highly unrealistic with no plan or details; ignores practicalities like timelines, resources, or compliance.
        2: Basic plan but lacks detail; feasibility is questionable, with overlooked healthcare considerations.
        3: Adequate plan with reasonable timelines and resources; addresses key feasibilities but could be more detailed.
        4: Strong, practical plan with clear steps, timelines, and allocations; effectively handles healthcare specifics.
        5: Highly feasible with a detailed, viable implementation plan; demonstrates complete readiness for internal execution.
