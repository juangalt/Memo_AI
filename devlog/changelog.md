  - Backend requirements: FastAPI, Anthropic, SQLite, YAML, security packages
  - Frontend requirements: Streamlit, requests, data visualization
  - All dependencies install without errors
  - All imports work correctly
  - Environment file template created
  - Development log initialized

### üéØ Design Decisions Made
- Used Python 3.11.2 virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Implemented comprehensive database schema with WAL mode for concurrent access
- Created modular configuration validation system with specific rules per file type
- Fixed validation script to match actual YAML structure (rubric vs grading_criteria)
- Removed sqlite3 from requirements.txt as it's part of Python standard library
- Used bcrypt for secure password hashing in database initialization

### üõ†Ô∏è Issues Encountered and Resolutions
- **Issue**: Database created in wrong location (backend/data/ instead of data/)
  - **Resolution**: Moved database file to correct location and updated path handling
- **Issue**: sqlite3 package not found in PyPI
  - **Resolution**: Removed from requirements.txt as it's part of Python standard library
- **Issue**: Configuration validation script expected 'grading_criteria' but file had 'rubric'
  - **Resolution**: Updated validation script to match actual YAML structure
- **Issue**: Missing bcrypt dependency for database initialization
  - **Resolution**: Installed bcrypt package for secure password hashing

### üìã Devspec Inconsistencies Found
- Validation script in backend/validate_config.py had incorrect field names for rubric.yaml
- The script expected 'grading_criteria' but the actual YAML structure uses 'rubric' at root level
- Updated validation script to match the actual structure defined in 03_Data_Model.md

### üß† Learning Insights
- SQLite WAL mode is essential for concurrent access in containerized environments
- YAML validation requires understanding of actual file structure, not just expected fields
- Virtual environment isolation is crucial for reproducible development setup
- Database initialization should include comprehensive verification and testing
- Configuration validation should be specific to each file type with detailed rules

### üîç Testing Results
- All milestone validation procedures passed
- Database operations successful with proper schema and indexes
- Configuration files load and validate correctly
- All Python dependencies install and import successfully
- Docker and development tools working as expected

### üìä Phase 1 Summary

- Implemented comprehensive health checks for all system components
- Used environment variable overrides for configuration flexibility

### üõ†Ô∏è Issues Encountered and Resolutions
- **Issue**: Import errors with database manager instance
