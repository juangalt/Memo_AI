## 5.0 Integration with Existing Documentation

### 5.1 Devspecs Integration
- Historical `devspecs/` documents remain in the repository for context but are no longer maintained.
- All future work must reference files in `docs/` as the canonical specifications.
- When discrepancies arise, the documentation in this directory takes precedence.

### 5.2 Changelog Integration
- The development log (`devlog/changelog.md`) is frozen after Phase 8 and serves as an implementation history.
- New changes should be documented directly in commit messages and pull request descriptions.
- Historical entries may be referenced for context or lessons learned.

### 5.3 Code Integration
- **Code Examples**: Include relevant code snippets
- **File References**: Link to specific source files
- **API Documentation**: Document all public APIs
