# Test: Progress Bar Fix in Text Input Page

## Test Steps

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Navigate to the application**:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost`
   - Login with any credentials (mock mode)

3. **Go to Text Input page**:
   - Click "Text Input" in the top menu
   - Verify you're on the text submission page

4. **Submit text for evaluation**:
   - Enter some text in the textarea (at least 50+ characters)
   - Click "Submit for Evaluation" button

5. **Observe the progress bar**:
   - **Initial State**: Progress bar should start at 0%
   - **Increment**: Progress should increase smoothly from 0% to 100%
   - **Maximum Cap**: Progress should stop at exactly 100% and not continue growing
   - **Status Updates**: Should see different status messages as progress increases:
     - "üìù Analyzing text structure..." (0-30%)
     - "üß† Processing with AI..." (31-60%)
     - "üìä Generating feedback..." (61-90%)
     - "‚úÖ Finalizing evaluation..." (91-100%)

6. **Verify completion**:
   - Progress bar should reach 100% and stay there
   - Should redirect to Overall Feedback page when complete
   - No overflow beyond 100% should occur

## Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ Progress bar starts at 0%
- ‚úÖ Progress increments smoothly
- ‚úÖ Progress stops at exactly 100% (no overflow)
- ‚úÖ Status messages update appropriately
- ‚úÖ Progress bar completes when API response is received
- ‚úÖ Redirects to feedback page after completion

## What Was Fixed

**Before**: Progress bar would continue growing beyond 100% indefinitely
```javascript
progress.value += 1  // Could exceed 100%
```

**After**: Progress bar is capped at 100%
```javascript
progress.value = Math.min(progress.value + 1, 100)  // Maximum 100%
```

## Troubleshooting

If progress bar still overflows:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the TextInput component is properly loaded
3. Ensure the progress calculation is working correctly
4. Check that the Math.min() function is being applied
