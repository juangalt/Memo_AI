## [2024-08-31] Fixed Home Page "Get Started" Button for Authenticated Users

### **Issue Resolved**: 
- **Problem**: "Get Started" button on home page always went to login page, even when user was already authenticated

### **Button Behavior**:
- ✅ **Not Authenticated**: "Get Started" → Login page
- ✅ **Authenticated**: "Get Started" → Text Input page (main application)

### **Implementation**:
- ✅ **Added authentication check** using `useAuthStore` and `computed` property
- ✅ **Conditional routing** with `:to="isAuthenticated ? '/text-input' : '/login'"`
- ✅ **Seamless user experience** for both new and returning users

### **User Experience**:
- **New Users**: Click "Get Started" → Login → Text Input
- **Returning Users**: Click "Get Started" → Direct to Text Input
- **Consistent Flow**: All users end up at the main application functionality

### **Files Modified**:
- `vue-frontend/src/views/Home.vue` - Added conditional routing logic for "Get Started" button

## [2024-08-31] Fixed Navigation Links Redirecting to Root

### **Issue Resolved**: 
- **Problem**: Top menu navigation links were redirecting to the root path (`/`) instead of the correct routes
- **Root Cause**: Layout component had incorrect route paths in the navigation links
- **Solution**: Fixed navigation links to use the correct route paths that match the router configuration

### **Navigation Links Fixed**:
- ✅ **Text Input** - Changed from `/` to `/text-input`
- ✅ **Overall Feedback** - Changed from `/feedback` to `/overall-feedback`
- ✅ **Admin** - Already correct at `/admin`

### **Router Configuration Match**:

## [2024-08-31] Fixed Login Redirect Issue

### **Issue Resolved**: 
- **Problem**: After successful login, users were redirected to the root path (`/`) which shows a development progress page instead of the main application
- **Root Cause**: Login component defaulted to redirecting to `/` instead of the main application page
- **Solution**: Changed default redirect to `/text-input` which is the main application page

### **Fix Applied**:
- ✅ **Login.vue** - Changed default redirect from `/` to `/text-input`

## [2024-08-31] Fixed Blank Main Body Content and Completed Tailwind Reversion

### **Issue Resolved**:

- **Solution**: Simplified App.vue to use `<RouterView />` and added Layout wrapper to individual view components

### **Components Fixed**:
- ✅ **App.vue** - Simplified to use RouterView for all routes
- ✅ **TextInput.vue** - Added Layout wrapper, already using Tailwind classes

### **Tailwind Classes Now Working**:
- ✅ **OverallFeedback**: `bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-8 border-l-4 border-blue-500`
- ✅ **Strengths/Opportunities**: `bg-green-50`, `bg-yellow-50` with proper spacing
- ✅ **Buttons**: `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors`
- ✅ **Layout**: `max-w-6xl mx-auto`, `space-y-8`, `grid grid-cols-1 gap-6`

### **Components Successfully Reverted**:
1. ✅ **ProgressBar** - Working with Tailwind classes
2. ✅ **TextInput** - Working with Tailwind classes + Layout wrapper

## [2024-08-31] Added Conditional Admin Menu Display

### **Security Improvement**: 
- **Issue**: Admin and Debug menu items were visible to all users, even non-admin users

### **Menu Items Now Conditional**:
- ✅ **Admin Link** - Only visible when `isAdmin` is true
