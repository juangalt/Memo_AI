## 11.0 Pending Design Decisions

### 11.1 Real LLM Testing Strategy
**Decision Required**: Balance between development velocity and performance validation accuracy

**Alternatives**:
1. **Mock-First with Limited Real LLM Validation**: Use mocks for development, real LLM only for critical validation
   - **Pros**: Fast development cycles, cost-effective, predictable testing
   - **Cons**: May miss real LLM performance issues, limited accuracy validation
   - **Suggestion**: Implement mock-first approach with scheduled real LLM validation runs

2. **Hybrid Approach with Cost Controls**: Mix of mock and real LLM testing with budget limits
   - **Pros**: Balanced accuracy and cost, gradual validation, controlled expenses
   - **Cons**: Complex test configuration, potential inconsistency
   - **Suggestion**: Use hybrid approach with clear cost controls and validation schedules

3. **Real LLM-First for Critical Paths**: Use real LLM for all critical evaluation flows
   - **Pros**: Maximum accuracy, real-world validation, comprehensive testing
   - **Cons**: High cost, slower development cycles, potential rate limiting
   - **Suggestion**: Reserve for production validation and critical path testing only

**Recommendation**: Implement mock-first approach with scheduled real LLM validation, focusing on cost control while ensuring performance requirements are met.

### 11.2 Test Data Management Strategy
**Decision Required**: Balance between realistic test data and maintainability

**Alternatives**:
1. **Static Fixtures with Version Control**: Maintained test data with clear versioning
   - **Pros**: Predictable tests, easy debugging, consistent results
   - **Cons**: May not reflect real LLM behavior, requires manual updates
   - **Suggestion**: Use static fixtures for unit and integration tests

2. **Dynamic Generation with Real LLM**: Generate test data from real LLM responses
   - **Pros**: Realistic data, reflects actual behavior, self-updating
   - **Cons**: Cost, potential flakiness, complex management
   - **Suggestion**: Use for critical validation tests only

3. **Hybrid Approach with Evolution**: Start with static data, evolve based on real LLM behavior
   - **Pros**: Balanced approach, gradual improvement, cost-effective
   - **Cons**: Requires careful management, potential inconsistency
   - **Suggestion**: Implement hybrid approach with clear evolution procedures

**Recommendation**: Use static fixtures for development with periodic updates based on real LLM behavior, ensuring consistency while maintaining realism.

### 11.3 Performance Testing Frequency
**Decision Required**: Balance between comprehensive performance validation and development velocity

**Alternatives**:
1. **Scheduled Performance Validation**: Regular performance testing with real LLM
   - **Pros**: Consistent validation, early detection of issues, controlled cost
   - **Cons**: May miss performance regressions, delayed feedback
   - **Suggestion**: Implement weekly performance validation with real LLM

2. **Continuous Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with alerts
   - **Pros**: Immediate feedback, comprehensive monitoring, early issue detection
   - **Cons**: High cost, complex setup, potential noise
   - **Suggestion**: Reserve for production environments with performance requirements

3. **On-Demand Performance Testing**: Manual performance testing when needed
   - **Pros**: Cost-effective, focused testing, developer control
   - **Cons**: May miss issues, inconsistent validation, manual overhead
   - **Suggestion**: Use for development with clear triggers for performance testing

**Recommendation**: Implement scheduled performance validation with clear triggers for additional testing, balancing cost and validation needs.

### 11.4 Test Environment Strategy
**Decision Required**: Balance between test isolation and realistic environment simulation

**Alternatives**:
1. **Isolated Test Environments**: Separate environments for each test type
   - **Pros**: Clean isolation, predictable results, no interference
   - **Cons**: Resource overhead, complex setup, potential inconsistency
   - **Suggestion**: Use isolated environments for critical tests

2. **Shared Test Environment**: Single environment for all tests
   - **Pros**: Resource efficient, simple setup, realistic conditions
   - **Cons**: Potential interference, shared state issues, harder debugging
   - **Suggestion**: Use shared environment for integration and E2E tests

3. **Hybrid Environment Strategy**: Mix of isolated and shared environments
   - **Pros**: Balanced approach, appropriate isolation, resource efficiency
   - **Cons**: Complex management, potential confusion
   - **Suggestion**: Implement hybrid strategy with clear environment purposes

**Recommendation**: Use isolated environments for unit tests and shared environments for integration tests, with clear cleanup procedures.

### 11.5 Test Automation Strategy
**Decision Required**: Balance between comprehensive automation and development velocity

**Alternatives**:
1. **Selective Automation**: Automate critical tests only
   - **Pros**: Fast implementation, focused coverage, maintainable
   - **Cons**: Limited coverage, manual testing overhead
   - **Suggestion**: Start with selective automation for critical paths

2. **Comprehensive Automation**: Automate all test types
   - **Pros**: Maximum coverage, consistent execution, reduced manual effort
   - **Cons**: Complex setup, maintenance overhead, potential flakiness
   - **Suggestion**: Implement comprehensive automation for production environments

3. **Progressive Automation**: Start simple, gradually increase automation
   - **Pros**: Manageable implementation, gradual improvement, learn from experience
   - **Cons**: Inconsistent coverage during transition, ongoing changes
   - **Suggestion**: Implement progressive automation with clear milestones

**Recommendation**: Start with selective automation for critical paths, gradually expanding coverage based on team experience and requirements.
