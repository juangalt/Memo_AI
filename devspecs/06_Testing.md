## 2.0 Key High-Level Decisions Needed

### 2.1 Testing Framework Selection
**Question**: What testing frameworks should we use for each component?
- Frontend testing: Reflex testing patterns vs traditional web testing?
- Backend testing: pytest vs unittest vs other Python frameworks?
- Integration testing: FastAPI TestClient vs full application testing?
- Should we use behavior-driven development (BDD) tools?

### 2.2 Test Environment Strategy
**Question**: How should we structure test environments and data?
- In-memory SQLite vs persistent test database?
- Mock LLM responses vs test LLM calls vs hybrid approach?
- How do we handle test data setup and teardown?
- Should we use Docker for test isolation?

### 2.3 LLM Testing Strategy
**Question**: How do we test the core LLM evaluation functionality?
- Mock LLM responses for consistent testing?
- Use actual LLM calls with test prompts?
- How do we test prompt engineering and response parsing?
- What's the strategy for testing different LLM providers?

### 2.4 Test Coverage and Quality Metrics
**Question**: What are our testing standards and coverage requirements?
- Minimum code coverage percentage (80%, 90%)?
- Which components require 100% coverage (critical paths)?
- How do we measure and enforce test quality?
- Should we use mutation testing for robustness?

### 2.5 Performance and Load Testing
**Question**: How should we validate performance requirements?
- Load testing strategy for concurrent users?
- Performance benchmarks for LLM response times?
- How do we test the 15-second submission response requirement?
- Database performance testing under load?

### 2.6 End-to-End Testing Strategy
**Question**: How should we test complete user workflows?
- Browser automation tools (Selenium, Playwright)?
- API testing vs UI testing vs both?
- How do we test complex flows like evaluation → chat → PDF export?
- Should we test across different browsers?

### 2.7 Configuration and Admin Testing
**Question**: How do we test the YAML configuration system?
- Testing YAML validation and error handling?
- Testing configuration version management?
- How do we test admin functions without breaking production configs?
- Testing the filesystem ↔ database configuration sync?

### 2.8 Security and Privacy Testing
**Question**: How do we validate security requirements?
- Testing session isolation and data privacy?
- Input sanitization and injection attack testing?
- Authentication system testing (when enabled)?
- How do we test the authentication on/off switch?

### 2.9 Continuous Integration Strategy
**Question**: How should we automate testing in the development workflow?
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality?
- Automated test running on code changes?
- How do we handle flaky tests (especially LLM-dependent ones)?
- Test result reporting and failure notifications?

### 2.10 Debug Mode Testing
**Question**: How do we test debug functionality without exposing sensitive data?
- Testing debug data collection and storage?
- Ensuring debug mode doesn't leak sensitive information?
- Testing debug output formatting and accessibility?
- Performance impact testing of debug mode?
