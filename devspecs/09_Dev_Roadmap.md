## 2.0 Key High-Level Decisions Needed

### 2.1 MVP Phase Definition and Scope
**Question**: What constitutes the minimum viable product for initial release?
- Which features are essential for MVP vs nice-to-have?
- Should authentication be implemented but disabled, or completely omitted from MVP?
- What level of UI polish is required for MVP vs later iterations?
- Which admin functions are critical for MVP operation?

### 2.2 Development Phase Prioritization
**Question**: How should we prioritize development phases for maximum value delivery?
- Backend-first vs frontend-first vs parallel development approach?
- When should we integrate with LLM providers (early vs late in development)?
- How do we handle database design changes across phases?
- What's the priority order for testing implementation?

### 2.3 Feature Rollout Strategy
**Question**: How should we incrementally deliver features to users?
- Phased feature rollout vs big-bang release approach?
- How do we handle feature flags and gradual enablement?
- Which features can be delivered independently vs require full system?
- What's the strategy for user feedback integration during development?

### 2.4 Technical Debt and Refactoring Planning
**Question**: When should we address technical debt vs deliver new features?
- Planned refactoring phases vs continuous improvement?
- When should we migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL?
- How do we balance rapid MVP delivery with long-term maintainability?
- What's the strategy for scaling architecture improvements?

### 2.5 Testing and Quality Gates
**Question**: What quality gates should we establish for each development phase?
- Testing requirements for MVP vs later phases?
- When should we implement comprehensive test suites?
- How do we balance speed of delivery with code quality?
- What are the go/no-go criteria for each phase?

### 2.6 Performance and Scalability Milestones
**Question**: When should we address performance and scalability requirements?
- Performance optimization in MVP vs later phases?
- When should we implement caching, monitoring, and optimization?
- How do we validate scalability from 1 to 100+ users?
- What are the triggers for infrastructure upgrades?

### 2.7 Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
**Question**: How should we maintain documentation throughout development?
- Documentation requirements for each phase?
- When should we create user documentation vs admin documentation?
- How do we ensure knowledge transfer and maintainability?
- What's the strategy for API documentation maintenance?

### 2.8 Risk Management and Contingency Planning
**Question**: What risks should we plan for and how do we mitigate them?
- LLM provider changes or outages during development?
- Technology stack changes or compatibility issues?
- Performance bottlenecks discovered late in development?
- How do we handle scope creep and timeline pressure?

### 2.9 Success Metrics and Validation
**Question**: How do we measure success and validate each development phase?
- Technical success metrics (performance, reliability, maintainability)?
- User success metrics (usability, effectiveness, satisfaction)?
- Business success metrics (adoption, value delivery)?
- How do we validate requirements fulfillment?

### 2.10 Post-MVP Evolution Planning
**Question**: How should we plan for system evolution beyond MVP?
- Feature enhancement roadmap and prioritization?
- Technology stack evolution and upgrade planning?
- User base growth and scaling timeline?
- Integration with external systems and platforms?
