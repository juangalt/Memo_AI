## 2.0 Development Approach

- **MVP‑first**, delivering core evaluation quickly then iterating.  
- **Agile** process with two‑week sprints, continuous integration and code review.  
- Every feature gated by tests and documentation.

## 3.0 Phased Roadmap

### 3.1 Phase 1 – MVP Core (Weeks 1‑6)
```yaml
Goals:
  - Text submission and evaluation endpoint
  - Display overall feedback
  - Basic tab navigation and global state
  - YAML admin editing
  - Dockerised deployment
Exit Criteria:
  - Requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 met
  - Basic tests passing; deployable via docker-compose
```

### 3.2 Phase 2 – Feature Expansion (Weeks 7‑12)
```yaml
Additions:
  - Detailed segment feedback and chat panel
  - Progress tracking charts
  - PDF export
  - Debug mode UI and endpoints
  - CI pipeline with unit/integration tests
Exit Criteria:
  - Requirements 2.2.3b, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 satisfied
  - Coverage ≥85%
```

### 3.3 Phase 3 – Hardening & Scalability (Weeks 13‑18)
```yaml
Additions:
  - Optional authentication (JWT + session)
  - Performance tuning and load testing
  - Monitoring/alerting setup
  - Production deployment docs and scripts
Exit Criteria:
  - Non‑functional requirements 3.1‑3.4 met
  - Stable production release candidate
```

### 3.4 Phase 4 – Post‑MVP Enhancements (Beyond Week 18)
```yaml
Ideas:
  - Additional evaluation frameworks
  - RAG and alternative LLM providers
  - Advanced analytics and reports
  - Mobile‑friendly redesign
```

---

## 4.0 Quality Gates

- All code reviewed and merged via pull request.
- Tests green and lint/type checks pass before merge.
- Documentation updated with each feature.

---

## 5.0 Risk Management

```yaml
Risks:
  - LLM provider limits -> mitigate with caching and mock tests
  - Scope creep -> maintain strict MVP definition
  - Data loss -> nightly backups and restore drills
  - Performance issues -> early profiling and load tests
```

---

## 6.0 Long‑Term Evolution

- Plan for PostgreSQL migration and multi‑instance scaling when user load grows.
- Iterate on UI/UX based on user feedback.
- Track technology updates for Reflex, FastAPI and Python.

---

## 7.0 Traceability Links

- Consolidates success criteria from all previous specs (`01`‑`08`).
- Completion of each phase corresponds to acceptance criteria in `01_Requirements.md`.
