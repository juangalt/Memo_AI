## 2.0 Functional Requirements

2.1 **User Interface (GUI)**

- 2.1.2 Navigation between functions (help, text input, overall feedback, detailed feedback, debug) is implemented as tab switches that preserve session data and load quickly.
- 2.1.3 Information bubbles appear on hover, explaining each section.
- 2.1.4 The Help tab displays usage information and resources to learn the rubric and frameworks.
- 2.1.5 The site must be visually clean but also pleasing.

  - (a) Overall evaluation including strengths, opportunities, and rubric grading.
  - (b) Segment-level evaluation with comments and insight questions.
- 2.2.4 Evaluation processing is straightforward with immediate feedback.

2.3 **Text Evaluation System**
- 2.3.1 The system uses a grading rubric for evaluation.
- 2.3.2 The system uses prompt templates for LLM interactions.
- 2.3.3 The system provides overall strengths and improvement opportunities.

2.5 **Debug Mode**
- 2.5.1 In debug mode, admins can review debug output for system diagnostics.
