## 1.0 How to Use This File

1.1 **Audience**
- AI coding agents and human developers.

1.2 **Purpose**
- Defines the REST API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication patterns for the Memo AI Coach project.
- Builds directly on the architecture defined in `02_Architecture.md` and data model in `03_Data_Model.md`.

1.3 **Next Steps**
- Review this file before proceeding to `05_UI_UX.md`.

## 2.0 Key High-Level Decisions Needed

### 2.1 API Authentication Strategy
**Question**: How should we implement the authentication system that's ready but disabled for MVP?
- Should we use JWT tokens, session cookies, or API keys?
- How do we handle the on/off switch for authentication?
- What's the strategy for transitioning from session-based to authenticated users?

### 2.2 Request/Response Format Standardization
**Question**: What should be the standard API response format across all endpoints?
- Should we use a consistent wrapper format (e.g., `{data: {}, meta: {}, errors: []})?
- How do we handle error responses consistently?
- What HTTP status codes should we use for different scenarios?

### 2.3 API Versioning Strategy
**Question**: How should we prepare for future API changes?
- Should we implement versioning from the start (v1 prefix) or defer until needed?
- URL-based versioning (/api/v1/) vs header-based vs parameter-based?
- How do we handle backward compatibility?

### 2.4 File Upload and Download Handling
**Question**: How should we handle PDF exports and potential file uploads?
- Direct file serving vs signed URLs vs streaming responses?
- Where should generated PDFs be stored temporarily?
- What's the cleanup strategy for temporary files?

### 2.5 Real-time vs Polling for LLM Responses
**Question**: How should we handle potentially long-running LLM evaluation requests?
- Synchronous requests with longer timeouts?
- Asynchronous with polling endpoints?
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates?
- Server-sent events for progress updates?

### 2.6 Rate Limiting and Performance
**Question**: What rate limiting should we implement to prevent abuse?
- Per-session rate limits for text submissions?
- Per-IP rate limits for the overall API?
- Different limits for different endpoint types?
- How do we handle rate limit responses?

### 2.7 API Documentation Strategy
**Question**: How should we document and maintain API specifications?
- Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation?
- Manual documentation with examples?
- Interactive API explorer for development?
- How do we keep documentation in sync with implementation?

### 2.8 Error Handling and Validation
**Question**: How should we handle input validation and error responses?
- Client-side validation vs server-side validation vs both?
- Detailed validation error messages vs simple error codes?
- How do we handle LLM provider errors gracefully?
- What's the fallback strategy for service failures?
