## 2.0 Maintenance Strategy

### 2.1 Philosophy
- Proactive monitoring with automated alerts.
- Changes tracked in version control and reviewed before deployment.

### 2.2 Schedule
```yaml
Daily:    health checks, log review, temp file cleanup
Weekly:   performance review, database vacuum, backup verification
Monthly:  dependency updates, security scan, capacity review
Quarterly: architecture assessment, roadmap alignment
```

## 3.0 Monitoring and Alerting

- Prometheus collects metrics; Grafana dashboards visualise system health.
- Alertmanager or equivalent sends notifications on threshold breaches (CPU, errors, latency, LLM quota).
- Heartbeat endpoints checked every minute.

---

## 4.0 Log Management

- Structured JSON logs; shipped to centralized store (e.g., Loki or ELK).
- Retain 30 days online, archive for 1 year.
- Sensitive data stripped before logging.

---

## 5.0 Database and Storage Maintenance

- SQLite file vacuumed weekly and integrity checked monthly.
- Retain last 100 submissions per user (per data model decision).
- Backups encrypted and stored off‑site; restoration tested quarterly.

---

## 6.0 Security and Patch Management

- Dependabot or equivalent monitors dependencies; updates merged monthly or on CVE release.
- OS and Docker base images patched regularly.
- Regular review of authentication logs and failed login attempts.

---

## 7.0 Configuration Management

- YAML configuration files stored in Git and mirrored in database cache.
- Changes occur via pull request with review and automated validation tests.
- Production configs updated via admin interface; version history retained.

---

## 8.0 Support and Issue Resolution

- Issues tracked through a ticket system or GitHub Issues.
- Knowledge base contains user FAQ, rubric explanation and troubleshooting steps.
- Critical incidents require post‑mortem within 48 hours.

---

## 9.0 Performance and Capacity Planning

- Monitor response times and concurrency to predict scaling needs.
- Load tests repeated before major releases.
- Plan database migration to PostgreSQL when SQLite metrics approach limits.

---

## 10.0 Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- Operations runbook stored in repository `docs/` directory.
- Development and maintenance notes updated alongside code changes.
- Onboarding checklist maintained for new contributors.

---

## 11.0 Traceability Links

- Addresses reliability (3.3), performance (3.1), scalability (3.2), security (3.4), maintainability (3.5).
- Builds upon deployment plan (`07_Deployment.md`) and testing strategy (`06_Testing.md`).
