## 2.0 Key High-Level Decisions Needed

### 2.1 Monitoring and Alerting Strategy
**Question**: What monitoring should we implement for ongoing system health?
- Application performance monitoring (APM) tools vs custom monitoring?
- What metrics should trigger alerts (response times, error rates, resource usage)?
- How do we monitor LLM provider performance and costs?
- Should we implement user experience monitoring?

### 2.2 Log Management and Analysis
**Question**: How should we handle log collection and analysis for troubleshooting?
- Centralized logging vs local file logging?
- Log retention policies and storage management?
- What log levels and information should we capture?
- How do we handle sensitive data in logs (debug mode considerations)?

### 2.3 Database Maintenance and Optimization
**Question**: What ongoing database maintenance procedures should we establish?
- Regular database cleanup and archival procedures?
- Performance monitoring and query optimization?
- Index maintenance and statistics updates?
- When and how to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL?

### 2.4 Security Updates and Patch Management
**Question**: How should we handle security updates and vulnerability management?
- Automated dependency updates vs manual review process?
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment procedures?
- How do we handle urgent security patches?
- What's the process for updating LLM provider integrations?

### 2.5 Configuration Management and Version Control
**Question**: How should we manage ongoing configuration changes?
- Version control for YAML configuration updates?
- Change approval and testing procedures for configurations?
- How do we track configuration changes and their impacts?
- Rollback procedures for problematic configuration changes?

### 2.6 User Support and Issue Resolution
**Question**: What support processes should we establish for users?
- Issue tracking and resolution procedures?
- User feedback collection and prioritization?
- How do we handle user data issues or corruption?
- Support documentation and knowledge base management?

### 2.7 Performance Optimization and Capacity Planning
**Question**: How should we continuously optimize and plan for growth?
- Regular performance testing and benchmarking?
- Capacity planning for user growth (1 â†’ 100+ users)?
- Cost optimization for LLM usage and infrastructure?
- When to implement caching, CDNs, or other optimizations?

### 2.8 Backup and Recovery Procedures
**Question**: What ongoing backup and recovery procedures should we maintain?
- Automated backup testing and validation?
- Disaster recovery testing procedures?
- How do we handle partial data loss or corruption?
- Business continuity planning for extended outages?

### 2.9 Code Quality and Technical Debt Management
**Question**: How should we maintain code quality over time?
- Regular code review and refactoring procedures?
- Technical debt identification and prioritization?
- Dependency updates and maintenance schedules?
- Code quality metrics and improvement processes?

### 2.10 Compliance and Audit Requirements
**Question**: What ongoing compliance and audit procedures should we establish?
- Data retention and privacy compliance procedures?
- Audit logging and compliance reporting?
- How do we handle data subject requests (if applicable)?
- Regular security and compliance assessments?
