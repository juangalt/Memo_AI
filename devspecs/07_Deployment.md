## 2.0 Key High-Level Decisions Needed

### 2.1 Container Strategy and Docker Architecture
**Question**: How should we structure the Docker containers for optimal deployment?
- Single container vs multi-container (frontend/backend separation)?
- How do we handle the SQLite database in containerized environments?
- What's the strategy for YAML configuration files in containers?
- Should we use Docker Compose for development vs production?

### 2.2 Environment Configuration Management
**Question**: How should we manage different environments (dev/staging/production)?
- Environment variables vs configuration files vs both?
- How do we handle sensitive data (LLM API keys, database paths)?
- What's the strategy for environment-specific YAML configurations?
- How do we handle the authentication on/off switch across environments?

### 2.3 Database Deployment and Persistence
**Question**: How should we handle SQLite database persistence in production?
- Docker volumes vs external storage vs database migration to PostgreSQL?
- Backup and recovery strategies in containerized environments?
- How do we handle database migrations during deployments?
- What's the scaling path from SQLite to PostgreSQL?

### 2.4 LLM Provider Integration and API Management
**Question**: How should we manage LLM provider credentials and configurations?
- API key management and rotation strategies?
- How do we handle different LLM providers in different environments?
- Rate limiting and cost management for LLM API calls?
- Fallback strategies for LLM provider outages?

### 2.5 Scaling and Load Balancing
**Question**: How should we prepare for scaling from 1 to 100+ users?
- Horizontal scaling strategies for stateless applications?
- How do we handle session persistence across multiple instances?
- Load balancing requirements and strategies?
- Database scaling considerations (connection pooling, read replicas)?

### 2.6 Monitoring and Observability
**Question**: What monitoring should we implement for production operations?
- Application health checks and readiness probes?
- Performance monitoring for LLM response times?
- Error tracking and alerting strategies?
- Log aggregation and analysis requirements?

### 2.7 Security and Network Configuration
**Question**: How should we secure the production deployment?
- HTTPS/TLS configuration and certificate management?
- Network security and firewall configurations?
- Authentication system security when enabled?
- Input sanitization and rate limiting at the infrastructure level?

### 2.8 Deployment Automation and CI/CD
**Question**: How should we automate the deployment process?
- Continuous deployment vs manual releases?
- Blue-green deployments vs rolling updates vs recreate strategy?
- Automated testing requirements before deployment?
- Rollback strategies for failed deployments?

### 2.9 File Storage and Static Assets
**Question**: How should we handle file storage for PDFs and configurations?
- Local file storage vs cloud storage (S3, etc.)?
- Temporary file cleanup strategies?
- Static asset serving (CSS, JS, images)?
- YAML configuration file storage and versioning?

### 2.10 Backup and Disaster Recovery
**Question**: What backup and recovery procedures should we implement?
- Database backup frequency and retention policies?
- Configuration file backup strategies?
- Full system backup and recovery procedures?
- Testing backup restoration processes?
