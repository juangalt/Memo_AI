## 2.0 Key High-Level Decisions Needed

### 2.1 Reflex Framework Implementation Strategy
**Question**: How should we structure the Reflex application for optimal maintainability?
- Component-based architecture vs page-based architecture?
- How do we implement the global state manager in Reflex?
- What's the strategy for code splitting and component reusability?

### 2.2 Tab Navigation and State Persistence
**Question**: How should we implement the tabbed interface with state preservation?
- Native Reflex routing vs custom tab switching?
- How do we ensure tab switching is fast (<1s as required)?
- What data should persist across tabs vs what should reload?

### 2.3 Visual Design and Theming Strategy
**Question**: What should be the visual design approach for "clean and visually pleasing"?
- Should we use a CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap) or custom styles?
- How do we implement consistent theming across components?
- What's the color scheme and typography strategy?

### 2.4 Progress Visualization Design
**Question**: How should we display progress tracking data in the dedicated tab?
- What types of charts should we use (line charts, bar charts, progress meters)?
- Should we use a charting library (Chart.js, D3) or custom visualizations?
- How do we handle different time ranges and data aggregations?

### 2.5 Responsive Design Strategy
**Question**: How should the application adapt to different screen sizes?
- Mobile-first vs desktop-first design approach?
- How do tabs work on mobile devices?
- What's the minimum supported screen size?

### 2.6 Loading States and User Feedback
**Question**: How should we handle the potentially long LLM response times?
- Loading spinners vs progress bars vs skeleton screens?
- How do we provide feedback during 15-second evaluation processing?
- Should we show estimated time remaining?

### 2.7 Error Handling and User Messages
**Question**: How should we display errors and success messages to users?
- Toast notifications vs inline messages vs modal dialogs?
- How do we handle network errors gracefully?
- What's the strategy for user-friendly error messages?

### 2.8 Form Design and Input Validation
**Question**: How should we design the text input and admin forms?
- Real-time validation vs submit-time validation?
- How do we provide guidance for rubric and framework editing?
- What's the strategy for handling large text inputs?

### 2.9 Help and Documentation Integration
**Question**: How should we implement the Help tab with rubric/framework resources?
- Static content vs dynamic help based on context?
- Inline help tooltips vs dedicated help sections?
- How do we make complex rubrics and frameworks understandable?

### 2.10 Accessibility and Usability
**Question**: What accessibility standards should we target?
- WCAG compliance level (A, AA, AAA)?
- Keyboard navigation patterns?
- Screen reader compatibility requirements?
